# Security Policy

IntellectualSites takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately use our software in a secure environment.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities through [this form](https://forms.gle/btgdRn9yhGtzEiGW8).
The form is configured in such a way that only the reporter and the team can see the details.
By restricting access to this potentially sensitive information, we can work on a fix and deliver it before the method of attack becomes well-known.
