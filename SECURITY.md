## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities through [this form](https://forms.gle/btgdRn9yhGtzEiGW8).  
The form is configured in such a way that only the reporter and the IntellectualSites project maintainers can see the details.
By restricting access to this potentially sensitive information, we can work on a fix and deliver it, before a vulnerability becomes well known.

### Issue Handling
If you have submitted a properly filled out report, the project maintainers will look into your issue shortly.   
Keep in mind, that we may choose to reject issues, if they are not feasible for us to address, due to limitations of the Minecraft codebase.

### Attribution policy
We will credit reporters who informed us in private by filling out the form above in security releases published.
