# Security Policy

IntellectualSites takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately use our software in a secure environment.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities through [this form](https://forms.gle/btgdRn9yhGtzEiGW8).  
The form is configured in such a way that only the reporter and the IntellectualSites project maintainers can see the details.
By restricting access to this potentially sensitive information, we can work on a fix and deliver it before the method of attack becomes well-known.

### Issue Handling
If you have submitted a properly filled out report, the project maintainers will look into your issue shortly.   
Keep in mind, that we may choose to reject issues, if they are not feasible for us to address, due limitations or native handling in the Minecraft server code itself.

### Attribution policy
We will credit reporters who informed us in private by filling out the form above in advisories published.

### Gift policy
We want to show our appreciation to people privately reporting issues in our software by sending them a small gift.   
While our beloved projects are developed voluntarily in our free time and funded by coffee and long nights, we are not able to offer "bug bounties".

We're offering to send you an IntellectualSites mug and a bunch of project stickers.

To be sent a gift, you need to be an **eligible reporter** and have reported an **eligible issue**.

#### Eligible Reporters
Almost everyone is eligible to receive security gifts, with the following exceptions:
- **No project maintainers**: If you are part of the @IntellectualSites/core-team, you are not eligible for a gift.
- **No previous recipients**: If you've received a gift for reporting a security vulnerability in the past, we're not going to send you another one, sorry.

#### Eligible Issues
- **Private reports only**: Issues need to be [reported privately](https://forms.gle/btgdRn9yhGtzEiGW8) and cannot have been published elsewhere before an advisory was released.
- **Accepted issues only**: Your submitted issue needs to be accepted in order to be eligible for a security gift.
- **Previously unknown**: Only issues project maintainers were previously unaware of are eligible.
- **Publications**: Issues need to have been fixed and announced in a security advisory.

#### Process
Once a project maintainer has resolved the issue and a fix has been published, the reporter is eligible for this reward. We'll generally contact the reporter and offer them to send a gift.
