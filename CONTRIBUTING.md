**Never report security issues on GitHub, public issues or other public channels (Discord etc.), follow the instruction from the  [Security advisory](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to report it in private.**

We appreciate any kind of contributions: code, documentation, design, etc. Any contribution counts, and the size does not matter!

## Newcomers

If you are a newcomer contributor, look for the label `Good first issue`. Issues labeled like that can be resolved without having an in depth knowledge about the codebase you are contributing to.


### IDE Configuration

If a project has a code style policy, you can find an `.editorconfig` file in the root directory of the project. If you're using IntelliJ, you can install the `EditorConfig` plugin. Writing or reformatting files now follows our standards.

### Source code contribution

- For larger contributions create an issue for any required discussion
- Implement the solution on a branch in your fork that is **not the main branch**
- Make sure to phrase the commit message following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/).   
For an example from maintaners, take a look at the commit history.
- Once you're done, create a pull request. GitHub will request a review from a maintainer automatically.
    - Remember to title your pull request properly as it is used for release notes.

### Run locally
To get started, you will need the following software, most of which can be obtained in (most) package managers such as `apt` (Debian / Ubuntu), `homebrew` (macOS / Linux), and more:
- `git` (package `git` everywhere)
- A Java 16 or later JDK (packages vary).
    - [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) has builds for most operating systems.
    - If not stated otherwise, our projects make use of Gradle's [Toolchain](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html) feature to allow building with only JRE 8 or later installed. (Gradle will automatically provision JDK 16 for compilation if it cannot find an existing install).

If you are on Windows, you can download git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The instructions for Java apply nevertheless.

If you're compiling with Docker, you can use Adoptium's
[`eclipse-temurin`](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin/) images like so:
```console
# docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/data --rm eclipse-temurin:16.0.2_7-jdk bash
Pulling image...

root@abcdefg1234:/# javac -version
javac 16.0.2
```

Compiling is done by invoking the steps `clean` and `build` with the project's build tool.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### My commit doesn't need a build, what do I do?
Well, quite simple: You add `[ci skip]` to the start of your commit subject.

This case most often applies to changes to files like `README.md`, this very file (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), the `LICENSE.md` file, and so forth.
